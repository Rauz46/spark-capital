## Page-by-Page Content

### 1. HOME PAGE

#### Hero Section:
- Tagline: "Venture Studio led Startup Investing"
- Main Heading: "A New Way to Invest in New Ventures"
- Description: "We are a Venture Capital firm that invests in Enterprise AI Startups via our Venture Studio. We do this via a unique two fund model. Fund 1 invests and initially owns 100% of new startups that are incubated from ideas generated internally via our Venture Studio. While Fund 2 invests only after a startup gets to breakeven and is on track to $1million in ARR. Fund 2's growth capital accelerates the startups to multimillion revenue and readies it for external investors."
- Sub-text: "Our core team consists of industry leaders from top-tier technology and venture capital companies, with experience in bootstrapping and growing tech startups to multimillion revenue. We are US market focused, with our headquarters in Tampa, Florida; and have global offices in London, UK and Chennai, India."

#### Fund Flow Diagram:

#### Three Phase Model Section:
- **Heading**: "Our Unique 3 Phase Startup Investing Model"
- **Subheading**: "Our investing model takes a startup from ideation to MVP to revenue and beyond. We do this through a unique 3 phase startup investing model."

**Phase 1 - Pre-seed Investing via Fund 1:**
- Image: Business/startup illustration
- Text: "Fund 1 invests and initially owns 100% of new startups incubated via our Venture Studio; and builds the startups from idea to $1M ARR. Post which the startup exits our Venture Studio and moves to Phase 2 of investing."

**Phase 2 - Seed Investing via Fund 2:**
- Image: Growth/scaling illustration
- Text: "Fund 2 invests in Phase 2 and takes 20-30% equity in the startup, with another 10-20% equity made available for a proven sales leader to take on the CEO role and to accelerate the startup to multimillion revenue."

**Phase 3 - Series A Investing via External Investors:**
- Image: Investment/success illustration
- Text: "Phase 3 is when External Investors enter the startup's cap table. During this phase the startup will be on track to multimillion revenue and starts to operate fully independently as a fast growing tech company."
- CTA: "Read more" button linking to investors page

#### Our Story Section:
- **Heading**: "Our Story"
- **Text**: "Spark Capital was born out of our frustration as Angel Investors, having seen way too many startups perish at the infamous Death Valley curve. Our core teams extensive experience in bootstrapping and growing tech startups to multimillion revenue, led us to a new way to invest and incubate B2B tech startups. It taught us the importance of execution over the ideas itself, the criticality of getting to paying customers quickly and the necessity to scale the startup beyond $1million ARR. Our investment model via Venture Studio is based on these learning and our early success with some of our startups getting to multimillion in annuity revenues."
- CTA: "Read more" button

#### Rocket Venture Studio Section:
- **Heading**: "Our Venture Studio - Rocket"
- **Text**: "Rocket, our Venture Studio, incubates and grows startups using a Launch-Scale-Exit-Repeat model. Rocket's objective is to get each startup it incubates to paying customers and to at least $1million ARR. Post which the startup exits our Venture Studio and becomes an independent company under Spark Capital's portfolio."
- **Visual**: Circular diagram or GIF showing: Launch → Scale → Exit → Repeat cycle
- CTA: "Read more" button

#### Our Funds Section:
- **Heading**: "Our Funds"
- **Subheading**: "Our capital strategy is built to confront the hardest phase of startup risk head-on. Fund 1 absorbs early uncertainty through ownership, control, and deep validation inside our Venture Studio. Fund 2 enters once the path forward is clear, revenue is established, and growth becomes repeatable. This structure allows risk to fall before capital scales."

**Fund 2 Panel (Left):**
- Label: "Open to LPs"
- Heading: "Fund 2"
- Description: "Having seen success with Fund 1, we are now on our 2nd Fund and continuing to onboard Limited Partners or LPs to Fund 2. With Fund 2, our aim is to enable LPs to participate in startup investing after early validation and revenue milestones are achieved. This means, Fund 2 comes in as growth capital for the startups and also the transition to a new leader for the next phase of the startups growth. Fund 2 takes 20 to 30% equity, with 10 to 20% allocated to incoming leadership, resulting in a planned and transparent dilution of Fund 1.

Fund II follows an LP-first structure where investor capital is returned in full, followed by a 7–8% preferred return, before profits are shared under a standard 80/20 carry. Investing only in post-revenue enterprise AI companies, the fund lowers risk while offering predictable cash flows, clear exits, and strong, risk-adjusted upside."

**At a glance:**
- Fund 2 invests only in post-revenue enterprise AI companies.
- Structured Equity Participation with up to 30% made available to Fund 2
- Clear exit strategies and structured liquidity events
- Predefined dilution and alignment across Funds

**Fund 1 Panel (Right):**
- Label: "Fully Subscribed"
- Heading: "Fund 1"
- Description: "Our Fund 1 invests and owns 100% of new startups that are incubated from ideas generated internally via our Venture Studio. It invests in our Venture Studio startups with an objective to achieve 3 key milestones – initial set of paying customers and getting the startup to breakeven, and then to at least $1million in ARR. We achieve this through our Venture Studio which has a repeatable model of launching, scaling and exiting startups to Fund 2 and External Investors. This ensures that our startups are past the Death Valley curve, the stage where most startups fail, and where most Angel Investors and VCs lose capital.

Our portfolio includes Ignitho, Piqual, Talentou, Prodeia, and Caimue, with many more in the pipeline spanning B2B SaaS and enterprise AI products."

**At a glance:**
- 5 portfolio companies launched so far
